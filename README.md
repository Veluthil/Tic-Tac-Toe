# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Python script for playing the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Game Rules

- The game is played by two players.
- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- Each cell on the grid is represented by a number from 0 to 8.
- Players take turns and enter the number of the cell they want to place their symbol on.
- The first player uses "❌" as their symbol, and the second player uses "⭕".
- The goal is to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Example Game

Here's an example game to illustrate the gameplay and outcome:

```
  ❌ | 1 | ❌ 
  ⭕ | ⭕ | ⭕ 
  ❌ | 7 | 8 

Player ⭕ is the winner!
```

```
  ❌ | ⭕ | ❌ 
  ❌ | ❌ | ⭕ 
  ⭕ | ❌ | ⭕ 

The game ends in a draw.
